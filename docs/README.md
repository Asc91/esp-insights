# Hosted Documentation

[TODO]: <> (Fix the link)
* Check here: https://insights.espressif.com/docs/c-apis/en/latest

The above URL is for the main branch latest version.

# Building Documentation

* Install `make` and `doxygen` for your platform (`make` may already be installed as an ESP-IDF prerequisite).
* Change to the docs directory and run `make html`
* `make` will probably prompt you to run a python pip install step to get some other Python-related prerequisites. Run the command as shown, then re-run `make html` to build the docs.
